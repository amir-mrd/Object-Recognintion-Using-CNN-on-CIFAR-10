# Object-Recognintion-Using-CNN-on-CIFAR-10

CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.

In this example, I will use the TensorFlow library to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification model for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
